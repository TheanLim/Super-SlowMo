# Super-SlowMo
A PyTorch implmentation of "Super SloMo: High Quality Estimation of Multiple Intermediate Frames for Video Interpolation", Jiang et. al. CVPR 2018.
The math notations from the paper is used in this implementation.

Part of the codes are inspired by [vinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo](https://github.com/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo) and [NVIDIA/unsupervised-video-interpolation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/unsupervised-video-interpolation)
